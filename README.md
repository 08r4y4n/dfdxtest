# stag: Strongly Typed Auto Grad

Ergonomics & safety focused reverse mode auto differentiation[1] in Rust. 

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Reverse_accumulation

## Features

1. ðŸ‘Œ Simple Neural Networks API, completely type checked at compile time. See [examples/regression.rs](examples/regression.rs)

```rust
type MLP = (
    (Linear<10, 32>, ReLU),
    (Linear<32, 32>, ReLU),
    (Linear<32, 2>, Tanh),
);

fn main() {
    let mlp: MLP = Default::default();
    let x: Tensor1D<10> = Tensor1D::zeros();
    let y /*: Tensor1D<2>*/ = mlp.forward(x);
    println!("{:?}", y);
}
```

2. ðŸ“ˆ Ergnomic & safe Optimizer API

```rust
let mut model = ...
let mut sgd = Sgd::new(1e-2, Some(Momentum::Nesterov(0.9)));

let loss: Tensor0D<WithTape> = ...

// run backprop to get the gradients
let gradients = loss.backward();
sgd.update(&mut model, gradients);
```

4. ðŸ’¡ Tensor sizes, operations, gradient computations all type checked at compile time
5. ðŸ’ª Full power of rust compiler & llvm optimizations (because all shapes of arrays are known at compile time!)
6. Minimal runtime costs - there are no Rc/Refcells used in this implementation!
7. 100% safe rust code

## Fun/notable implementation details

### Module

```rust
pub trait Module<Input>: Default + CanUpdateWithGrads {
    type Output;
    fn forward(&self, input: Input) -> Self::Output;
}
```

From this flexible trait we get:
1. Single & batched inputs (just have multiple impls!)
2. Update with gradients
3. Multiple inputs/outputs (multi-headed modules, or rnns)

### Tuples represent feedforward (a.k.a sequential) modules

Since we can implement traits for tuples, which is *not possible in other languages* AFAIK, they provide a very nice frontend
for sequentially executing modules.

```rust
impl<Input, A, B> Module<Input> for (A, B)
where
    Input: Tensor,
    A: Module<Input>,        // A is a module that takes Input
    B: Module<A::Output>,    // B is a module that takes A's Output
{
    type Output = B::Output; // the output of this is B's Output
    fn forward(&self, x: Input) -> Self::Output {
        let x = self.0.forward(x);
        let x = self.1.forward(x);
        x
    }
}
```

We've implemented Module for Tuples up to 6 elements, but *you can arbitrarily nest them*!

### No Rc/RefCells used - Gradient tape is not reference counted!

Other implementations may store a reference to the gradient tape directly on tensors, which requires mutating tensors or using Rc/Refcells all other the place.

We've figured out an elegant way to avoid this, reducing references and dynamic reference count checks to 0!

Since all operations result in exactly 1 child, we can always move the gradient tape to the child of the last operation. Additionally, no model parameters (all tensors) will ever own the gradient tape because they will never be the result of any operation. This means we know exactly which tensor owns the gradient tape, and the tensors that have it will always be intermediate results that don't need to be maintained across gradient computation.

*All of this together gives users unprecedented control/precision over what tensors are recorded on the gradient tape!*

One advanced use case requires that tensors be re-used multiple times in a computation graph.
This can be handled by duplicating the tensor, and manually moving the gradient tape around.
See [examples/multi_head.rs](examples/multi_head.rs) for an example.

### Type checked backward

tl;dr: If you forget to include a call to `trace()`, the program won't compile!

```diff
-let pred = module.forward(x);
+let pred = module.forward(x.trace());
let loss = (&y - pred).square().mean();
let gradients = loss.backward();
```

Since we know exactly what tensors own the gradient tape, we can require the tensor passed into `.backward()` to own the gradient tape!
And further, we can require it be moved into `.backward()`, so it can destruct the tape and construct the gradients!

__All of this can be checked at compile time ðŸŽ‰___

```rust
pub fn backward<T: Tensor<TapeHolder = WithTape>>(t: T) -> Gradients {
    let (t, tape_holder): (T::NoTape, WithTape) = t.split_tape_holder();
    tape_holder.0.backward(&t)
}
```

### Array Backend

Our [src/array_ops](src/array_ops/) backend for computing results operations
is built using __recursive trait definitions__.

The main idea behind this is similar to recursion or induction proofs. First we specify
the base trait, and then we specify the recursive trait.

A simple example is counting the number of elements in an arbitrarily nested array
at compile time.

First we specify the trait we want to do this:

```rust
pub trait CountElements {
    const NUM_ELEMENTS: usize;
}
```

Now for the base case (assuming these will be arrays of floats), is just a single floating point number:

```rust
impl CountElements for f32 {
    const NUM_ELEMENTS: usize = 1;
}
```

And finally the recursive trait:

```rust
impl<T: CountElements, const M: usize> CountElements for [T; M] {
    const NUM_ELEMENTS: usize = M * T::NUM_ELEMENTS;
}
```

Notice the restriction on T also implementing `CountElements`. This allows us to use `T::NUM_ELEMENTS` in the trait body.

Another few powerful things recursive traits can do:
1. Map all elements of arbitarily nested arrays using a function
2. Add two arrays together
3. Reduce an array to one number
4. Even more!
